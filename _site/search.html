        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The best type of CRM is the one you donât use, and we have one for you that will improve your lead generation tremendously.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!Why donât we use CRMs?Theyâre not the most efficient way to interact with our database. Theyâre clunky, cumbersome, and time-consuming. We get stuck managing the CRM when all weâre looking for is a CRM to manage us.This dilemma was the inspiration behind the creation of Kelle, the AI-inspired personal assistant we use at Keller Williams. Kelle is basically the Siri of the real estate business, and hereâs how it can help you.When youâre on the new KW system, no matter where you go online, Kelle tracks your business activity. When I say, âKelle, please send me the top five people I should call today,â itâs not sending me the names of people that I scheduled to call or the names of those I havenât called in a while. It sends me potential clients based on their online buying or selling activity as well.It can also send you contacts based on which Facebook ads are performing the best. Facebook is integrated with the KW cloud to the point that we know whoâs using what ad and how theyâre performing. Essentially, KW is working together as a group to streamline their lead generation efforts. In addition, if someone likes a Facebook post you make but theyâre not in your contact list, Kelle will notify you and give you the option of adding them to your list.Thatâs your CRM working for you, not you managing your CRM.âKELLE IS BASICALLY THE SIRI OF THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.âWhat else can Kelle do? Letâs say that same person who liked your Facebook post and whom Kelle added to your contact list scheduled a listing appointment with you. When you pull up to their home, you can ask Kelle to send you a market analysis of that home to your phone. Once itâs on your phone, you can send it to their phone so they have it before you even walk in the door.From there, you can ask Kelle to send you a home DNA while you walk through the house. Youâll have pictures of all the surrounding listings, and your potential client can pick which ones are better or worse than their home. They can choose where they land in the CMA and decide how much their home is worth.After that, Kelle can determine the type of buyer whoâs most likely to buy that home and search your database for matching buyers.So ask yourselfâwhat will you do with tools that are focused on helping you stay in your 20% so you can receive 80% of your life back? It doesnât cost you any extra outside of the normal monthly fees you pay. You canât get this software for a fraction of what it costs to be at KW. In fact, you canât get it anywhere because it only exists at KW. Theyâre very intent on owning their software and having a family of agents build it with them.If youâd like to schedule a meeting to start putting together your launchpad or you have any other questions about how to get more out of your business, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to help you.",

However, hereâs what turned me on to the idea and why I time block every single one of my work days.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!Many of you have been to several time-management classes and hear the phrase âtime blockingâ ad nauseam. Iâve been there too. Finally, one day the right concepts aligned and it completely changed my mindset around time blocking. Iâm going to share these concepts with you today. Hereâs a brief outline of what I discussed in the video above, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the part(s) that interest you the most:0:40- Why too much white space in your calendar is a bad thing1:40- The mindset of a business person versus the mindset of a salesperson2:30- The major benefits of time blocking your schedule3:30- Why fitness is the first thing to schedule into your day4:45- What to time block during your work day7:00- How to schedule the back half of your dayIf you have any additional questions for me about time blocking, how to schedule your day, or about the real estate business in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today.

        "title": "What We Care About More Than Our Awards",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Keller Williams has received many different awards for our productivity, training, and more. Still, the thing we are most proud of is something else entirely: our culture.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!Keller Williams has had an absolutely stellar year. So far, 2018 has been a year of awards. Not only were we voted the happiest place to work by Forbes, but we were also ranked as the No. 1 real estate company in the world in terms of agent count, sales volume, and units sold. Above all of these accomplishments, though, there is one thing we are most proud ofâour culture.None of the achievements would be possible without the culture of learning that we uphold as a standard within our company. In fact, this emphasis on education has earned us yet another award. Keller Williams has also been voted No. 1 in the world for training.For our own team here in the East Valley, we have the most productivity per agent and are within the top three area brokerages. We believe that production is king, and our agents produce twice as much as professionals with most brokerages. Our culture encourages this level of production, because when our agents are strong contributors within our team, they also tend to be strong contributors within our community.âALL OF THIS IS JUST TO SAY THAT NO MATTER WHAT AWARDS WE RECEIVE, THE THING WE ARE MOST PROUD OF IS THAT WEâRE A CULTURE OF PRODUCTIVITY, LEARNING, AND CONTRIBUTION.âOne of the things I was most struck by when I joined Keller Williams was how the company responded to the Virginia floods. Despite the fact that there were no Keller Williams offices within 200 miles of the affected areas, the company was ready to help.Ever since the Joplin tornadoes, Keller Williams has had supply-stocked trailers stationed in all major disaster areas. While Virginia isnât actually a disaster area, Keller Williams still had an 18-wheeler trailer filled with supplies ready to move to the flood site. Our company was the first on the scenes, even before FEMA or the Red Cross.This same emphasis on community contributions is exactly the approach we took in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. We usually host a major event, the Keller Williams Mega Camp, in Austin, but last year we decided to change our Mega Camp to Mega Relief. Instead of converging in Austin, our 13,000 agents took buses to Houston to help with relief efforts.And beyond disaster relief, Keller Williams also makes an effort to give back in other ways. Keller Williams RED Day is a prime example of this. Each year on this day, our agents spend time with charities to help make a difference.All of this is just to say that no matter what awards we receive, the thing we are most proud of is that we are a culture of productivity, learning, and contribution. So if this sounds like the kind of culture you would like to be a part of, we would love for you to get in touch.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to schedule a meeting to talk about a future with Keller Williams, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "There are many different paths in real estate these days. Hereâs a quick look at all the different options that you have.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!Thereâs a big public misconception about Realtors. People think being a Realtor only involves turning a key, opening a door, and taking a picture of their clients jumping for joy in the air. However, there are so many opportunities in this industry that require so many different skill sets. The possibilities are endless.Do you have the needed skill set? Do you know about the different jobs available in this industry? If not, youâre in luck. Thatâs what weâre going to go over today.Real estate combines several industries into one. Every transaction needs a Realtor, a lender, a title representative, escrow officers, and more.When it comes to real estate, you can either operate as a single agent or a team leader. If youâre joining a team, there are so many different options. You can be a showing assistant, marketing assistant, or an inside sales agent. Thereâs a place for all skill sets.âCOME DOWN TO OUR OFFICE AND TAKE THE KW PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT.âIf youâre really good at talking to people and socializing, you might not be the best at paperwork. A single agent has to wear so many hats that itâs rare to find a good one anymore. A lot of times, single agents have weaknesses. Teams play up your strengths so you can focus on what you do best.Our company, Keller Williams, was built on personality.

        "content": "If youâre a new real estate agent who wants to be a top producer, stop chasing shiny objects and ask yourself these three questions.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!In our industry, thereâs no such thing as âone size fits all.â What works for one will not work for another, and itâs important to find out what we can do and, even more so, what we will do.Do you have a five-year plan? What about a one- or two-year plan?You need to build a successful plan of triggers and transitions to help you reach your goal and build a sustainable, successful business.So what will you do? What will you commit to doing? Are you a cold caller? A door knocker? Are open houses your thing? Social media and networking? Any of these is an avenue to success when paired with a good plan. You need a roadmap.âWHAT IS A GOOD PLAN WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY?âBut what is a good plan without accountability?These days, people use apps rather than actual maps. If youâve ever used Siri for directions, youâve heard its voice tell you itâs ârecalculating route.â Thatâs a statement of accountability. It lets you know that if you make a wrong turn or get off the highway to avoid traffic, Siri is still with you, still making sure you are going to get where youâre going.Ask yourself these three questions:  Do I need a plan?  Am I serious about being successful in the industry?  Am I willing to be held capable of reaching my destination?If you answered âyesâ to any of these, we can coach you. We will help you make a plan and realize rewards. Stop chasing shiny objects; you already have what it takes.Get started today by scheduling a free session with us. Please donât hesitate to reach out to me with any questions you may have. I would be happy to help you!",

Weâd like to offer you a bit of a shortcut.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!If youâre watching this, chances are youâre currently thumbing through your email. Most of the time, itâs a mindless habit of scrolling and deleting. How many mindless habits do you have in your business? I can tell you that most of the things on your to-do list are easy items that help us feel accomplished while avoiding what we truly need to do.The million-dollar question here is, âWhat am I focused on?â Gary Keller wrote a great book called âThe One Thingâ and in it, he proposes a focusing question: Whatâs the one thing that you can do, such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary.âLET ME HELP YOU BREAK THROUGH THAT CEILING.âWhether you realize it yet or not, youâre either in the beginning or the middle of this tear-down, rebuild, and repeat cycle of business. What or who does your business need to grow? With most successful businesses, itâs a who. Who do you need? Why do you need them? How do you find them?These are the exact questions that Gary Keller focused on as he turned the corner from a struggling local business to No. 1 in the world. Itâs what I focus on every day as an expansion leader and CEO. I coach mega agents in many different states on building their business through people. Let me help you break through that ceiling.If you have any questions or need help in your business, reach out and give me a call or send me an email to schedule a free coaching session.

Iâll explain what that means and how to find it today.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!In the real estate business, it is critically important that you develop your MVVBPâyour mission, vision, values, beliefs, and purpose for your life and your business. Each of these items should serve as guideposts along your track to success.Understanding the âwhyâ in your business is important. Knowing the reason behind what drives you will help you meet your goals. In business, the relationships you create are less about what you do, and more about why you do.âIF YOUâRE IN BUSINESS AND DONâT KNOW WHY, CALL SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP YOU FIGURE IT OUT.âWhen you know why you show up at your job every day, it makes it easier to do so. As for us, we adjust our âwhyâ as time goes on. As our goals change, so does our MVVBP.Adjusting your goals prevents you from going off in the wrong direction in your business.If you donât currently have an MVVBP, you should. And, if youâre in business and donât know why, call someone who can help you figure it out. You need to be working with a coach or a team of coaches in order to set a reasonable and effective set of goals.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

What does your pipeline look like? What do you have installed to maximize and leverage your listings into more business? Iâm here today with Lindsay Mozena, a team leader and coach here at Keller Williams East Valley, to give great tips on how to exceed your goals this year.We know that, in our industry, what we do now doesnât even affect our business until 90 days from now. And since listing season is here, right now, we need to get on the ball. If you havenât started to think about what youâre going to do for this listing season, you need to do so right now.Here at East Valley Real Estate, weâve been doing script practice every day, as well as practice with roleplay, door-knocking, open houses, and calling our databases. Weâve been really active in making sure that weâre doing lead generating activities every day.âYOU NEED TO COME IN AND GET PLUGGED IN.âTo leverage our listings, we have started pre-marketing to get listings on our database before they even go live. Zillow and other tech companies canât do that, since they only deal with live listings.In terms of the systems, we use KWLS, eEdge, CGI (Career Growth Initiative), and others to create goals, tasks, and pipelines. They track our progress automatically as we close deals. Specifically, the KWLS (Keller Williams Listing System) sends out listings to 300 websites before those listings go live.To track our pipeline and goals, we use our CGI, tracking it every single day. Agents are able to plug in their data about their activities, and we check every month to see if the data is in line with their goals.As a word of advice to someone who is just now realizing theyâre behind the ball, you need to come in and get plugged in.If your goal is to do 20 deals a year, but you havenât reached that yet, whatâs getting in your way? Schedule an appointment with us immediately and get the coaching that you need in order to take your business to the next level. For any other questions, feel free to contact us.

If you donât know how to adapt, we can help you.Interested in a FREE Business Consultation?Contact us Today!âYou donât know what you donât know.âHow many times have you heard that saying? Thatâs the problem many of us face when trying to grow a successful business in a volatile industry. We must recognize the changes affecting us as listing agents and buyerâs agents. In order to adapt, we must be on our toes.What does your brokerage do to help you recognize shifts? Did you know thereâs currently a nationwide down-pressure on buyer co-brokerage commissions? Websites like Opendoor and Zillow make it easy for buyers to find and see homes without having an agent. Not only is the pressure on the commission, but these factors could eventually negate the need for buyer agents completely. What are you doing to adapt? How are you being educated?âIF YOU JOIN US BY DECEMBER 31, WE WILL SAVE YOU $199 BY WAIVING YOUR SIGN-ON FEE!âListing agents are also up against Opendoor and OfferPad and many other small investors copying the instant-offer model. How strong is your value proposition? How will you compete? Is your brokerage innovative and providing you with ways to compete. The fact is, these companies are here to stay and theyâre gaining momentum.However, theyâre operating in a niche that will not work against us, but alongside the traditional real estate model. Theyâre not taking away our industryâtheyâre forcing us to take it back. What are you going to do to stand your ground? Better yet, how are you going to take territory?If your answer to any of these questions was âI donât know,â schedule a time to meet with me. If you join us by December 31, we will even save you $199 by waiving your sign-on fee!

In order to set a realistic goal, you need to figure out what your âwhyâ is. Now, weâre not talking about your âwhat.â Your âwhatâ is the amount of money you want to make, the vacations you want to go on, and the things you want to buy.

Once you have your âwhyâ, you can figure out your âwhatâ and start on the path towards fulfillment. In the meantime, youâll have to ask yourself questions like âDo I have the right tools?â and âAre these tools proven in helping agents successfully set and attain those goals?âAll of these questions are vital to successful growth, especially in our industry.

At that point, maybe you stuffed the plan in a folder somewhere and left it alone for six months until you needed to check where you were at.So, why is it that these plans donât get executed?First of all, your business plan should be in plain sight. If it isnât visible, you likely arenât going to think about it. When itâs in plain sight, it can act as a scoreboard.Your business plan should be staring at you every day. It is meant to keep track of your wins and your shortcomings.âYOUR BUSINESS DESERVES THE BEST.âImagine if you knew exactly how many more meetings you needed for a given week in order to meet your goals.At Keller Williams, we call this the Career Growth Initiativeâor CGI.Imagine youâve generated a lead that then went into your interactive pipeline, and then went on once more to become a contract. Your business plan should be able to forecast where youâre going. When you close, it should be able to tell you where youâre at.This is the point of CGI.Keller Williams believes in keeping a commitment to not only education and training, but to technology as well. I want to help you build a better plan for your business.
