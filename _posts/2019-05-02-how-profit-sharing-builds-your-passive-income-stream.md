If you’ve never heard of the concept of profit sharing, today we want to show you how it works.&nbsp;

If you follow along with the video above, you can see an example of the model we use here at Keller Williams. **For your convenience, we’ve provided timestamps of the video so you can skip ahead to whatever section you desire:**

1:18—The basis of our profit share model: The owners of each franchise give away 48% of their profits on a monthly basis to agents who help grow the company&nbsp;<br>2:00—Imagining yourself as “Mary” in the example&nbsp;<br>2:38—What happens if “Joan” decides to come to KW<br>4:43—How the seven other agents in the example benefit every time Joan sells a house<br>5:57—Defining profit share income&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about profit sharing and how it can benefit you, I want to invite you to a seminar we’ll be hosting on April 9 from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. here at our market center. We’ll also be live-streaming the seminar on Facebook Live if you can’t make it in person.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this subject, feel free to reach out to us in the meantime. We’d love to speak with you.
