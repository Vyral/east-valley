How does our positive environment help our agents to successfully grow their businesses? Today, I spoke with one of our newer agents, Allen, about how our systems have impacted him.

Today I’m here with one of our newer sales specialists, Allen Haynes.

Allen has been with us at Keller Williams East Valley for about five months but has been in the real estate business for eight years.

Right now, he says that business is skyrocketing. Productivity within the team, too, is also high. In fact, we offer productivity classes to help you grow your business.

Using our proven productivity systems, Allen has noticed a great increase in the number of listings and calls he receives.

Since starting with us, Allen approximates that he’s been averaging about 10 appointments per month, compared to the three to four he used to receive.

As is evident from the results Allen and others have seen, following our system can at least double your average business.

So what has led to this difference for Allen, personally?

He says the biggest change is how our environment has helped to alter his mindset. He’s noticed the way our agents are always willing to help one another.

Having a positive daily routine has made a huge difference for Allen and others like him.

Specifically, the kinds of activities that we do daily have made a big impact on our agents and the success of their businesses.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
