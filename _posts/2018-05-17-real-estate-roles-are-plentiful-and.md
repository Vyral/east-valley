There’s a big public misconception about Realtors. People think being a Realtor only involves turning a key, opening a door, and taking a picture of their clients jumping for joy in the air. However, there are so many opportunities in this industry that require so many different skill sets. **The possibilities are endless.**

Do you have the needed skill set? Do you know about the different jobs available in this industry? If not, you’re in luck. That’s what we’re going to go over today.

**Real estate combines several industries into one.** Every transaction needs a Realtor, a lender, a title representative, escrow officers, and more.

When it comes to real estate, you can either operate as a single agent or a team leader. If you’re joining a team, there are so many different options. You can be a showing assistant, marketing assistant, or an inside sales agent. There’s a place for all skill sets.

If you’re really good at talking to people and socializing, you might not be the best at paperwork. A single agent has to wear so many hats that it's rare to find a good one anymore. A lot of times, single agents have weaknesses. Teams play up your strengths so you can focus on what you do best.

Our company, Keller Williams, was built on personality. A lot of people get burnt out when they work as solo agents or they aren’t sure what they’re getting into. **Here at KW, we give candidates the Keller Williams personality assessment that helps them get into the right role and the right fit in this industry.**

If you’re interested in learning more about joining our team or joining the real estate industry in general, come on into our office. We’ll give you the personality test and find the perfect role for you. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
