If you’re watching this, chances are you’re currently thumbing through your email. Most of the time, it’s a mindless habit of scrolling and deleting. How many mindless habits do you have in your business? I can tell you that most of the things on your to-do list are easy items that help us feel accomplished while avoiding what we truly need to do.

The million-dollar question here is, “What am I focused on?” Gary Keller wrote a great book called “The One Thing” and in it, he proposes a focusing question: What’s the one thing that you can do, such that by doing it, everything else will be easier or unnecessary.

Whether you realize it yet or not, you’re either in the beginning or the middle of this tear-down, rebuild, and repeat cycle of business. What or who does your business need to grow? With most successful businesses, it’s a who. Who do you need? Why do you need them? How do you find them?

These are the exact questions that Gary Keller focused on as he turned the corner from a struggling local business to No. 1 in the world. It’s what I focus on every day as an expansion leader and CEO. I coach mega agents in many different states on building their business through people. Let me help you break through that ceiling.

If you have any questions or need help in your business, reach out and give me a call or send me an email to schedule a free coaching session. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
