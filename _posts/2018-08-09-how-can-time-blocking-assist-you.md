Time management in real estate is more or less a broken record. However, here’s what turned me on to the idea and why I time block every single one of my work days.

Many of you have been to several time-management classes and hear the phrase “time blocking” ad nauseam. I’ve been there too. Finally, one day the right concepts aligned and it completely changed my mindset around time blocking. I’m going to share these concepts with you today. **Here’s a brief outline of what I discussed in the video above, with timestamps so that you can skip ahead to the part(s) that interest you the most:**

0:40- Why too much white space in your calendar is a bad thing
1:40- The mindset of a business person versus the mindset of a salesperson
2:30- The major benefits of time blocking your schedule
3:30- Why fitness is the first thing to schedule into your day
4:45- What to time block during your work day
7:00- How to schedule the back half of your day

If you have any additional questions for me about time blocking, how to schedule your day, or about the real estate business in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
