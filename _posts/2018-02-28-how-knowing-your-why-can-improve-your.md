What is your MVVBP? I’ll explain what that means and how to find it today.

In the real estate business, it is critically important that you develop your MVVBP—your mission, vision, values, beliefs, and purpose for your life and your business. Each of these items should serve as guideposts along your track to success.

Understanding the “why” in your business is important. Knowing the reason behind what drives you will help you meet your goals. In business, the relationships you create are less about what you do, and more about why you do.

When you know why you show up at your job every day, it makes it easier to do so. **As for us, we adjust our “why” as time goes on. As our goals change, so does our MVVBP.**

Adjusting your goals prevents you from going off in the wrong direction in your business.

If you don’t currently have an MVVBP, you should. And, if you’re in business and don’t know why, call someone who can help you figure it out. You need to be working with a coach or a team of coaches in order to set a reasonable and effective set of goals.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
