Keller Williams has received many different awards for our productivity, training, and more. Still, the thing we are most proud of is something else entirely: our culture.

Keller Williams has had an absolutely stellar year. So far, 2018 has been a year of awards. Not only were we **voted the happiest place to work by Forbes, but we were also ranked as the No. 1 real estate company in the world in terms of agent count, sales volume, and units sold.** Above all of these accomplishments, though, there is one thing we are most proud of—our culture.

None of the achievements would be possible without the culture of learning that we uphold as a standard within our company. In fact, this emphasis on education has earned us yet another award. Keller Williams has also been voted No. 1 in the world for training.

For our own team here in the East Valley, we have the most productivity per agent and are within the top three area brokerages. We believe that production is king, and our agents produce twice as much as professionals with most brokerages. Our culture encourages this level of production, because when our agents are strong contributors within our team, they also tend to be strong contributors within our community.

One of the things I was most struck by when I joined Keller Williams was how the company responded to the Virginia floods. **Despite the fact that there were no Keller Williams offices within 200 miles of the affected areas, the company was ready to help.**

Ever since the Joplin tornadoes, Keller Williams has had supply-stocked trailers stationed in all major disaster areas. While Virginia isn’t actually a disaster area, Keller Williams still had an 18-wheeler trailer filled with supplies ready to move to the flood site. Our company was the first on the scenes, even before FEMA or the Red Cross.

This same emphasis on community contributions is exactly the approach we took in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. We usually host a major event, the Keller Williams Mega Camp, in Austin, but last year we decided to change our Mega Camp to Mega Relief. **Instead of converging in Austin, our 13,000 agents took buses to Houston to help with relief efforts.**

And beyond disaster relief, Keller Williams also makes an effort to give back in other ways. Keller Williams RED Day is a prime example of this. Each year on this day, our agents spend time with charities to help make a difference.

All of this is just to say that no matter what awards we receive, the thing we are most proud of is that we are a culture of productivity, learning, and contribution. So **if this sounds like the kind of culture you would like to be a part of, we would love for you to get in touch.**

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to schedule a meeting to talk about a future with Keller Williams, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
