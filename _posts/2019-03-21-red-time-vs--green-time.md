Allow me to take you back in time for a moment to the start of my entrepreneurial, commission-based career. The year was 1997, and though I wasn’t yet working in real estate, this was still the point at which my professional life would be forever changed.&nbsp;

At the time, my five children were between the ages of three and 13 so, as you can imagine, I was busier than a one-armed paper hanger. Most of my time was spent on work, and I was finding it difficult to balance the personal and professional aspects of my life. But that all changed when I met the man who would become my mentor.&nbsp;

Today, I’d like to share what this man taught me, and explain how the concept of Red Time vs. Green Time has transformed my life and career.
