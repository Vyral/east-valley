If you’re a new real estate agent who wants to be a top producer, stop chasing shiny objects and ask yourself these three questions.

In our industry, there’s no such thing as “one size fits all.” What works for one will not work for another, and it’s important to find out what we can do and, even more so, what we will do.

Do you have a five-year plan? What about a one- or two-year plan?

You need to build a successful plan of triggers and transitions to help you reach your goal and build a sustainable, successful business.

**So what will you do?** What will you commit to doing? Are you a cold caller? A door knocker? Are open houses your thing? Social media and networking? Any of these is an avenue to success when paired with a good plan. You need a roadmap.

But what is a good plan without accountability?

These days, people use apps rather than actual maps. If you’ve ever used Siri for directions, you’ve heard its voice tell you it’s “recalculating route.” **That’s a statement of accountability.** It lets you know that if you make a wrong turn or get off the highway to avoid traffic, Siri is still with you, still making sure you are going to get where you’re going.

Ask yourself these three questions:

1. Do I need a plan?
2. Am I serious about being successful in the industry?
3. Am I willing to be held capable of reaching my destination?

If you answered “yes” to any of these, we can coach you. We will help you make a plan and realize rewards. Stop chasing shiny objects; you already have what it takes.
