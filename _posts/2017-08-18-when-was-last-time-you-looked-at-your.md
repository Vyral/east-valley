If you’ve got a business, when was the last time you took a look at your business plan? Today, I want to share how I view business plans a little differently.

You may have a business plan—but is it interactive?

You’ve likely spent many hours in classes, and on your own time, working hard to develop a business plan.

However, once you finished you may have noticed that all you were left with for the final product was just that: a product. At that point, maybe you stuffed the plan in a folder somewhere and left it alone for six months until you needed to check where you were at.

So, why is it that these plans don’t get executed?

First of all, your business plan should be in plain sight. If it isn’t visible, you likely aren’t going to think about it. When it’s in plain sight, it can act as a scoreboard.

Your business plan should be staring at you every day. It is meant to keep track of your wins and your shortcomings.

 Imagine if you knew exactly how many more meetings you needed for a given week in order to meet your goals.

At Keller Williams, we call this the Career Growth Initiative—or CGI.

Imagine you’ve generated a lead that then went into your interactive pipeline, and then went on once more to become a contract. Your business plan should be able to forecast where you’re going. When you close, it should be able to tell you where you’re at.

This is the point of CGI.

Keller Williams believes in keeping a commitment to not only education and training, but to technology as well. I want to help you build a better plan for your business. Your business deserves the best.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to hear how I can help you build a better business, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
